## 2 Installation Requirements

myCobot 280 Arduino robot weights 780g. Due to the fact that the center of gravity will change along with the movement of the robot during utilization, robot is required to be fixed on a solid base at the beginning. A fixed base, or mobile base are both acceptable.

### Size of Base Interface 

* The base fixing holes act as the interface between robot and other bases or planes. The specific hole size is shown in the figure below. There are 4 countersunk holes with a diameter of 4.5 mm, which can be fixed with M4 bolts.

​																	![2.1.4.1.2P1](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.1-280/Arduino/2.1.4.3开箱与首次使用/arduino底座1.jpg) 

* Please make sure that there are corresponding threaded holes on the fixed base before installing.

#### *Before the installation, please confirm:*

- The environmental condition meets the requirements listed in Section 2.2.1.3.1 above.

- The installation position is no smaller than the working range of the robot, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance and repair.

- Put the base in a suitable position.

- Installation-related tools are prepared, such as screws, wrenches, etc.

- After confirming the above, please move the robot to the base installation table, adjust the robot position, and align the fixing holes of the robot base with the holes on the base mounting table. After aligning the holes, align the screws with the holes and tighten them.

> **Notice:** When adjusting the position of the robot on the base installation table, do not pushing or pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, do not applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body, so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

## 3 Power on the Robot

Before operation, confirm that you have read **Chapter 1 Safety Instructions** to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter with the robotic arm, and fix the base of the robotic arm on the table. The connection method is shown in Figure 3-1.

​																		<img src="../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.1-280/Arduino/2.1.8.3-2-001.png" alt="2.1.5.3-2-001" style="zoom:80%;" />

​																	Figure 3-1 Location of the power connector

myCobot must be powered on with an external power supply to provide sufficient power:

- Rated voltage: 8-12V
- Rated current: 3-5A

- Plug Type: DC 5.5mm x 2.1

You cannot just use the TypeC plugged into the M5Stack-basic for power supply. Please use the official power supply to avoid damage to the robotic arm.

### 4 Installation of Driver

Users can download the corresponding CP210X or CP34X driver according to the operating system they are using, and after decompressing the compressed package, select the installation package with the corresponding operating system digits for installation.

There are currently two driver chip versions, CP210X (applicable to CP2104 version) / CP34X (applicable to CH9102 version) driver package. If you are not sure which USB chip your device is using, you can install both drivers at the same time.

The installation tutorial can be viewed by scanning the QR code:
