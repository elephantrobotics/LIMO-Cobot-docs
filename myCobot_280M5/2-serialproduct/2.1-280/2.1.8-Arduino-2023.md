## 2 Performance

### Super expansion support,Unlimited Possibilities

- Standard **UART** serial interface, compatible with a variety of development board controls.
- Support extended with various types of development versions such as **ARDUINO MKRWIFI1010 \ MEGA2560 \ UNO**,etc.
- Provide the basic firmware of Mega and MKR development boards, and burn them to expand a variety of development methods.
- Supports multiple development control methods such as **Python, ROS, myBlockly, C++, and C#**.

### Unique industrial design and a compact structure

-   With an integrated design, it has a compact structure, weighting only 780g, which makes it portable.
-   Featuring a modular design and a concise shape, it is convenient to detach or change components so as to lower maintenance cost.
-   It can begin to work the moment plugged in.

### Powerful performance making development more user-friendly

- With 6 built-in servo motors, the product responds quickly and rotates smoothly due to little inertia

- Built-in kinematics forward and reverse solution algorithm, open standard SDK.

### LEGO connector and multiple application ecology of M5

-   With M5Stack-basic as the main control on pedestal, it meets various types of application.
-   LEGO interfaces on the pedestal and end enable the development of micro embedded devices.

### Supporting graphical programming and industrial robotic software

-   Adopting myBlockly, a visual programming software to ensure free and easy programming.
-   Supporting Arduino + ROS open-source system.

### Supporting record of tracks and coordinate

- Supporting drag teaching and recorded paths saving.
- Different paths up to 60 minus can be saved by new model instead of traditional model.
