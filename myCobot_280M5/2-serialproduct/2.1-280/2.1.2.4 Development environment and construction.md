# Development Environment Construction

## 1 Using Environment

myCobot 280 for Raspberry Pi comes with Ubantu (V-18.04) system, built-in Python, myStudio, myBlockly, ROS, OpenCV and driver libraries, so there is no need to download development software and install development environment (necessary Python repositories need to be installed by yourself). You only need to prepare a monitor to connect the robotic arm.

## 2 Development Environment

As myCobot 280 Raspberry Pi bears a built-in development environment, ypu can use directly.

The following are the development environments supported by the myCobot 280 for Raspberry Pi version and the installation and usage tutorials:

* [2.1 Development based on myBlockly and UIFlow](../../5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/README.md), which are both graphical programming software and visualization tools. Users can create programs dragging modules, the process of which is very similar to building blocks. After [installing myblockly ](../../5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.1-myblockly/README.md)and [UIFlow ](../../5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.2-UIFlow/5.2.1UIFlow_enviorment_building.md), refer to [myblockly use cases ](../../5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.1-myblockly/README.md)and [UIFlow use cases ](../../5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.2-UIFlow/5.2.7UIFlow_Use_Cases.md).

- [2.2 Development based on RoboFlow](../../6-ApplicationBaseRoboFlow/README.md). RoboFlow is the operating system developed for the Elephant collaborative robots. It serves to provide a human-computer interaction interface and its functions include coordinate control, angle control, io control, trajectory recording, gripper control, etc. Since the RoboFlow operating system runs through the teach pendant, users can use the teach pendant as a carrier to manually operate the robot, program and perform other operations. After [installing RoboFlow ](../../6-ApplicationBaseRoboFlow/6.1-roboflow_download.md), refer to see [simple use cases](../../6-ApplicationBaseRoboFlow/6.2-operation.md).

- [2.3 Development based on Python](../../7-ApplicationBasePython/README.md). Our robots support Python and the development of the Python API library has become increasingly complete. The joint angle, coordinates, gripper and other aspects of the robot can be controlled via Python. Refer to [installing the python environment , ](../../7-ApplicationBasePython/7.1_download.md)for more information.

- [2.4 Development based on ROS](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/README.md). ROS is open-source and is a post operating system, or secondary operating system, used for robot control. With the use of ROS, the simulation control of the manipulator can be realized in the virtual environment. The robotic arm can be visualized through the rviz platform, and operate the robotic arm in a variety of ways. It can also be used to plan and execute the robotic arm's action path through to freely control the robotic arm. After [installing the ROS development environment ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-环境搭建.md), refer to [use cases ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.4-rivz介绍及使用/README.md)and [use of moveit](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.5-Moveit/README.md) for more information.

## 3 Updating Firmware

The firmware of myCobot 280 for Raspberry Pi need to be updated via myStudio, which has been built in the robotic arm so as to be used directly.

Go to the address below for more information about myStudio:

- [4.1 myStudio](../../4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/README.md)
  - [4.1.2 Serial Port Driver Installation](../../4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/4.1.1-myStudio_download_driverinstalled.md)

- [4.2 Burning and Updating Firmwares](../../4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/4.1.2-myStudio_flash_firmwares.md)
