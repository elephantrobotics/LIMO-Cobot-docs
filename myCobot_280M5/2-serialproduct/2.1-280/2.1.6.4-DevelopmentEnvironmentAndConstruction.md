#### 2 linux

The Linux kernel was originally written as a hobby by Finn Linus Torvalds while he was a student at the University of Helsinki.

Linux is a set of Unix-like operating systems that are free to use and spread freely. It is a POSIX and UNIX-based multi-user, multi-task, multi-thread and multi-CPU operating system.

Linux can run major UNIX utility software, application programs and network protocols. It supports 32-bit and 64-bit hardware. Linux inherits Unix's network-centric design philosophy and is a multi-user network operating system with stable performance.

If you want to use the linux environment on your PC, you can install a virtual machine and ubuntu system

Since Python2 has been removed from Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, python3 is installed by default. It is recommended to use the 20.04 system here
