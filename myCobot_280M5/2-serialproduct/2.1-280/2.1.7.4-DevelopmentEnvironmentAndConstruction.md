# Development Environment Construction

## 1 Ubuntu Mate 20.04 System Introduction

**What is Ubuntu**

Ubuntu is the most widely used linux operating system for personal desktop operating systems. It is a good choice for beginners to get familiar with the linux environment or some embedded hardware operating systems. And the ubuntu official website also released a dedicated operating system for the Raspberry Pi.

### 1.1 System basic function introduction

#### 1.1.1 The difference between the system and the official release version

**Compared with the official system, we have made the following changes：**

- Integrating python/Ros1/Ros2 and other environments, users can directly use the built-in software provided by our company without setting up additional environments
- Have already installed our operating software (myStudio, myBlockly), no need to install it yourself
- Configure VNC screen sharing, it will have its own hotspot after booting, and you can connect to the screen through the remote connection tool-VNC without connecting to the display screen


#### 1.1.2 System basic function introduction

***Because  the myCobot 280 for Raspberry Pi version has a built-in development environment, the software introduced below can be used directly.***

##### 1 Desktop

4 Vim：text editor  Detailed [introduction](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/Vim)

5 Show Desktop：Click to display the desktop directly

6 Used to view CPU usage and memory usage

7 Recycle bin： It is used to store the documents temporarily deleted by the user, and the files stored in the recycle bin can be recovered

##### 3 Built-in Software

###### myStudio

- Burning and updating firmwares
- Providing tutorial data, such as user manuals and tutorial video
- Providing information about maintenance and repair

###### myBlockly

It is a piece of puzzle programming software based on python environments and pymycobot dependent libraries, which allows the user to do programming in a block building way to control mycobot. It is suitable for programming learners and can train their programming logic skills. myblockly also provides a python display interface, which can convert the myblockly program built by the user to a python language one to help the user learn python statements.

##### 4 link network

**wired connection**

***Currently myCobot 280 Jetson Nano only supports wired network***

Connect the network cable to the network port of the robot arm

### 1.2 Introduction to the development environment included in the system

#### 1 Ros1/Ros2

[Development based on ROS](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/README.md). ROS is open-source and is a post operating system, or secondary operating system, used for robot control. With the use of ROS, the simulation control of the manipulator can be realized in the virtual environment. The robotic arm can be visualized through the rviz platform, and operate the robotic arm in a variety of ways. It can also be used to plan and execute the robotic arm's action path through to freely control the robotic arm. After [installing the ROS development environment ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-环境搭建.md), refer to [use cases ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.4-rivz介绍及使用/README.md)and [use of moveit](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.5-Moveit/README.md) for more information.

#### 2 Python

[Development based on Python](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/). Our robots support Python and the development of the Python API library has become increasingly complete. The joint angle, coordinates, gripper and other aspects of the robot can be controlled via Python. Refer to [installing the python environment , ](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/7.1_download.html)for more information.



### 1.3 How to reset the system

When the system is damaged or the settings are wrong due to improper operation and cannot be changed, we can re-burn the system image and restore the initial settings（You will need an SD card reader）

The emergence of Ros solved the communication problem of each component of the robot. Later, more and more robot algorithms were integrated into ROS. **ROS2** inherited **ROS**, which is more powerful and better than **ROS**.
Compared with **ROS** that only supports Linux systems, **ROS2** also supports **windows**, **mac**, and even **RTOS** platforms.
After [installing the ROS2 development environment ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2-ROS2/12.2.1-ROS2的安装.md), refer to [ROS2 Use Cases ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2-ROS2/12.2.3-rivz介绍及使用/README.md) for more information.
