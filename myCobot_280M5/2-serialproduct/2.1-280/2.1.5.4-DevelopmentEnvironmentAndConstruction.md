### 1.2 Introduction to the development environment included in the system

#### 1 Ros1/Ros2

[Development based on ROS](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/README.md). ROS is open-source and is a post operating system, or secondary operating system, used for robot control. With the use of ROS, the simulation control of the manipulator can be realized in the virtual environment. The robotic arm can be visualized through the rviz platform, and operate the robotic arm in a variety of ways. It can also be used to plan and execute the robotic arm's action path through to freely control the robotic arm. After [installing the ROS development environment ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-环境搭建.md), refer to [use cases ](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.4-rivz介绍及使用/README.md)and [use of moveit](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.5-Moveit/README.md) for more information.
