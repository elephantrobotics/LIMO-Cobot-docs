* B. Power DC interface： It is a DC power socket with an outer diameter of 6.5 mm and an inner diameter of 2.0 mm; the 8.4V 5A DC power adapter provided by the manufacturer can be used to power the mycobot280.

* C. Switch: After pressing it, the internal power turnes on, and the key lights up with a white light; when it is pressed again, the white light turns off, so does the internal power.
  
* D. Type C interface： It can be used to connect and communicate with the PC.
 
* E. HDMI interface: This interface is HDMI type A interface. If you want to display the robot operation interface, show the operation page to other equipment terminals by connecting the HDMI display interface.

* F. USB2.0 interface: it is an interface for data connection conforming to the standard of main interface of 2.0; The USB port is used to copy program files and connect peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.

* G. USB3.0 interface: it is an interface for data connection conforming to the standard of main interface of 3.0; The USB port is used to copy program files and connect peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.
