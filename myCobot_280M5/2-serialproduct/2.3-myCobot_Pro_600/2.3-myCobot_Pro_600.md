![pro600](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/Pro600.jpg)

### 1 Product Introduction

The original design purpose of **myCobot Pro 600** is to provide people with a machine that can work repeatedly at any commmerical use-cases. Using a Raspberry Pi microprocessor and embedded with roboFlow visual programming software, it is a machine "helper" developed by Elephant Robotics for teaching and commercial use.

The body has a weight of 8.8kg, an effective load of 2kg, and a working radius of 600mm. It is characterized by delicate design, powerful function, easy operation and ability to work with human safely. With three advantages of usability, safety and economy, it is a cost-effective product. It can be quickly deployed in a working
environment, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency for universities and enterprises.

### 2 Product Performance

-   **Integrated design and safe collaborative work**
    -   The integrated design makes the product possible to make full use of the production space and to perfectly integrate itself into the actual environment.
    -   The anti-collision detection function based on an accurate dynamics model enables the product to work safely with human.

-   **Powerful performance and easy operation**
    -   The product adopts a harmonic reducer and a servo motor, and commercial robotic arms, with high-performance teaching.
    -   It features an exquisite structure, modular design, easy installation, quick disassembly and replacement.

-   **Raspberry Pi Control**
    -   Supports development systems such as ROS/Python, etc.
    -   Installed with a roboflow operating system independently developed by Elephant Robotics, which makes the product easy to  use.

-   **Economical and super cost-effective**
    -   It adopts a standard 7×24-hour working system and can perfectly replace highly repetitive and standard jobs.
    -   Being super cost-effective, it can effectively reduce costs and increase efficiency for the universities and enterprises with high performance and low cost.
