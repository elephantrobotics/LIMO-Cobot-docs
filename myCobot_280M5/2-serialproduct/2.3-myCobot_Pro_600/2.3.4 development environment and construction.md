### 2 development environment


- [2.1 Development and use based on roboflow](../../6-ApplicationBaseRoboFlow/README.md)
  Roboflow operating system is the operating system of elephant cooperative robot, which provides human-computer interaction interface (its functions include coordinate control, angle control, IO control, track recording, gripper control, etc.). Since the roboflow operating system is already embedded in our manipulator system, users can use the screen or remote connection as the carrier for manual robot operation, programming and other operations.

- [2.2 Development and use based on ROS](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/README.md)
  ROS is open source. It is a post operating system or secondary operating system for robot control. Through ROS, we can realize the simulation control of the manipulator in the virtual environment. We will realize the visualization of the manipulator through the rviz platform, and use a variety of ways to operate our manipulator; Plan and execute the action path of the manipulator through the moveit platform to achieve the effect of free control of the manipulator.After users [Install ROS development environment](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-环境搭建.md) ，users can read [Use case](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.4-rivz介绍及使用/README.md) and [Use of moveit](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.5-moveit/README.md)。

## 3 Use a virtual machine on the PC side

  - The system that comes with myCobot_Pro_600 does not support the use of ROS, but you can control ROS by using the Socket in the virtual machine on the PC side. The PC side should be connected to the same network as the robotic arm and connected using a network cable.

  - Install virtual machine environment and ROS environment on PC ([Building ROS development environment](../../12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-环境搭建.md))
  
  - After completing the environment setup, you need to enable the TCP service of the robotic arm. For details, please refer to [Secondary development of Python](2.3.6_Pyhton二次开发.md) chapter.

  - To verify whether the connection is successful, enter the following command in the virtual machine system terminal on the PC (for reference only, the actual IP address is subject to the robot arm):

    ```bash
    ping 192.168.1.159
    ```

**4.3.4 Fast move**

As shown in Figure 2-13, by clicking "Quick Moving", the window as shown in figure 2-14 will pop up. The control mode is divided into Cartesian coordinate control and joint control. The movement mode of moving can be continuous movement or step movement.

The Cartesian coordinate control refers to the linear movement on xyz-axis, and the robot can be controlled to move along the direction of Cartesian coordinate system by clicking the button corresponding to the direction of Cartesian coordinate system. Note that before using Cartesian control, you need to make sure that the second joint and the third joint shows a certain Angle.

Joint control provides the keys used by the operator to manually operate the robot with visual software and control the joint movement of the robot. The control keys of each joint are divided into two directions, and the Angle data of each axis can be seen.

#### 4.4 Calibration

After we start the robot arm, we can see the RoboFlow login interface, which represents the normal startup of our Raspberry PI system

![calibrate](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/myCobot Pro 600/English/calibrate1.png)

We need to move the manipulator by free movement, and the scale lines of each joint need to be aligned

![calibrate](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/myCobot Pro 600/English/calibrate1.jpg)

Adjust the alignment position of the six joints, and the manipulator will be in the following posture

![calibrate](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/myCobot Pro 600/English/calibrate2.jpg)

Move the mouse pointer to the top of the interface, click the Terminal Terminal in the upper left corner of the top menu bar, and enter PRO600_Calibrate into the Terminal (if there is no menu bar, the menu bar will unhide and display).
