### 1  Product Introduction

myAGV is the first mobile robot of Elephant. It adopts competition-grade Mecanum wheels and fully wraps the metal frame. The ROS development platform has two built-in slam algorithms to meet the learning of mapping and navigation directions. It provides rich expansion interfaces and can be equipped with my series. The robotic arm realizes mobile grabbing and completes more applications.



### 2 Product Performance

* **Omnidirectional movement**

  * Competition-level Mecanum wheels, Fully Wrapped Metal Frame, Removable Split Structure.

* **SLAM Lidar**

  * The built-in gmapping and cartographer algorithms for ROS.Real-time mapping and scanning of Lidar, automatic path planning for obstacle avoidance and navigation.
 

* **Built-in camera**

  * 5 million high-definition camera for object recognition and precise positioning.

* **Additional extensions**

  * Double-sided magazines on the body: increased batteries lengthen the working time; Can equip with the suction pump, and cooperate with the robotic arm to achieve more applications.

* **cargo robot**

  * Can carry and transport different sizes of cargo boxes arbitrarily, release your hands.

* **compound robot**

  * It can be equipped with my series of robotic arms to realize mobile grabbing, expand the workspace, and enable it to complete more tasks.

* **Multiple ways to play**

  * The gamepad control supports multi-robots collaboration in real-time.
