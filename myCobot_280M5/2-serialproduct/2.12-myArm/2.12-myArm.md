# myArm 300 Pi 2023
> The world's smallest integrated 7-DOF robot

### 1 Product Introduction

![pi](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.12-myArm/banner.jpg)

The myArm 300 Pi is an integrated **7-DOF** robot that uses the **Raspberry Pi 4B** as its main control board. It is paired with the **Ubuntu Mate 20.04** OS, specifically customized for robots by Elephant Robot. **No additional PC controller is needed**. By simply connecting a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, users can easily start basic development. This ensures that the robot no longer requires an external controller but still provides an experience similar to a **desktop PC**.

The myArm robot offers a maximum working arm length of **300mm**, **7 DOF** moving joints, supports a maximum end load of **200g**, controls for **zero-space posture elbow angles** (elbow joint rotation angle), and supports extensions for **myCobot series robot accessories**. It is the preferred choice for rapid construction of **robotic arm education**, **control logic teaching**, **robot applications**, and **ROS simulation classes**, helping you quickly start learning and applying the 7-axis robotic arm.
