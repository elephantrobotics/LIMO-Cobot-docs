### 1 Unpacking and working environment

**Note** : After the packaging box is in place, please confirm that the robot packaging is intact. If there is any damage, please contact the logistics company and the supplier in your area in time. After unpacking, please check the actual items in the box according to the item list.<img src="../../resourse/2-serialproduct/mecharm/开箱.jpg" alt="开箱" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 2 Installation conditions and requirements

 The actual weight of the mecharm robot is 1kg. Considering that during use, as the robot moves, its center of gravity will move, so the robot needs to be fixed on a solid base before it can be used normally. Base weight requirements: fixed base, or mobile base.

**Robot base interface size**

 The base fixing hole is the interface between the fixed robot and other bases or planes. The specific hole size is shown in the figure below, and it is installed with LEGO components.

Please make sure there are corresponding holes on the fixed base before installing.

Before the official installation, please confirm:

- The environment to be installed meets the requirements of Section 2.6.1.3 above.
- The installation position is not smaller than the working range of the robot, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance and repair.
- Put the stand in a suitable position.
- Installation related tools are ready.

 After confirming the above, please move the robot to the base mounting table, adjust the robot position, and align the fixing holes of the robot base with the holes on the base mounting table. After aligning the hole, press it.

 **Note**: When adjusting the position of the robot on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body, so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.



### 3 Power on the robot

Before operation, please confirm that you have read and ensured that you have followed the contents of Chapter 1 Safety Instructions to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter to the robotic arm, and fix the base of the robotic arm on the table. The connection method is shown in Figure 3-1.

​																						 Figure 3-1 Location of the power connector

​		mechArm must be powered with an external power supply to provide sufficient power:

-  Rated voltage: 8-12V

-  Rated current: 5A

-  Plug Type: DC 5.5mm x 2.5

Note that you can't just use the TypeC plugged into the M5Stack-basic for powering. Use an official power supply to avoid damage to the robotic arm.

### 4 Connecttion Type

#### Ubuntu（V-20.04）

**This system has a built-in network which can be directly connected, users can remote control robotics with VNC Viewer. No device such as a monitor is required**

- Download [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)

- Connect to a wireless network   `ElephantRobotics_AP` ，password is `Elephant`

- Open VNC and inpu the IP address of the robotics `10.42.0.1`

  ![图](../../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.7/2.7.3/vnc-input.png)

- Input VNC password `Elephant`

  ![图](../../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.7/2.7.3/vnc-connect.png)
  
- When you see this page, it means connect successfully

  ![图](../../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.7/2.7.3/vnc-display.png)

- If you want to control robotics directly，please refer to **Ubuntu（V-18.04）**


#### Ubuntu（V-18.04）

- Use the matching HDMI cable to connect the robotic arm and the monitor:

- First plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI port of the monitor.
