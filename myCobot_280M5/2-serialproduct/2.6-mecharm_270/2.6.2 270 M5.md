### 1 Product introduction
mechArm 270 M5 belongs to the "mechArm" series of small six-arm robotic arms of Elephant Robotics. M5Stack-basic is used as the main control and supports ROS simulation software. It is an industrial-like configuration launched by Elephant Robotics for maker innovation and robot industry-university-research services Small six-axis robotic arm.

The weight of the mechArm 270 M5 is 1kg, the load is 250g, and the working radius is 270mm. The design is compact and portable, small but powerful, easy to operate, and can work with people safely. As the first small six-axis robotic arm of Elephant Robotics, it has three advantages of ease of use, safety and economy, and is a cost-effective choice.
