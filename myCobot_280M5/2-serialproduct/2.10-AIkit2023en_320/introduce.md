### 1 Product introduction

+ The myCobot 320 AI Kit 2023 edition is an entry-level AI package that integrates positioning, automatic sorting, and object grasping modules. It features 5 major visual recognition algorithms, 7 application scenarios, and 2 gripping methods. With a maximum payload of 1kg, it is compatible with M5 and PI adapters for versatile robotic arm compatibility. It offers 8 learning points and supports visualization software. Built on the Python platform, it allows for software development to control the robotic arm. It is user-friendly and enables quick learning of AI fundamentals, inspiring innovative thinking and embracing open-source creative culture.

+ This set is highly scalable and versatile, catering to diverse needs and can be used for multiple purposes. It is suitable for easy use in university training platforms, robotics disciplines, robotics laboratories, or for personal learning and use.


### 2 Product performance:

* Four colored wooden blocks and cards of different shapes can be freely chosen. The set includes four ID QR codes that allow you to learn about the projection relationship between the 2D and 3D worlds. By studying image feature points, you can learn about image segmentation and save image features. The set also includes the YOLOv5 algorithm, which helps you understand neural networks. With object recognition, it can meet most of your needs for object grasping, enabling intelligent grasping. It supports unordered grasping and enhances the deep understanding of QR code recognition.
