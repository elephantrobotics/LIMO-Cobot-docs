### **1 Product Introduction**

Zero Basic Entry Level-Desktop Robotic Arm

​		The new series of myPalletizer elephant palletizing robot arm, which is jointly produced with M5STACK, is a fully packaged lightweight four-axis palletizing robot arm. The overall finless design is compact and easy to carry.

​		myPalletizer body weight 960g, load 250g, working radius 260mm; specially designed for makers and education, easy to use, rich expansion interfaces, unlimited development possibilities; a variety of AI suit options, machine vision, composite robots, etc., learn about the cutting-edge technology of learning robots Knowledge inspires innovative thinking.

### **2 Product performance**

- The fin design, the appearance is fully wrapped
  - The optimal space-removing fin design concept that can be loaded into a backpack subverts the traditional link-type educational four-axis robotic arm.

- LED dual display
  - The robotic arm carries two display screens, which is easy to expand the interactive output of the application, and the gameplay is unlimited.

- LEGO ecology, compatible with all my series accessories
  - The patented Lego hole design is shared globally, and the my series hardware ecological platform concept is implemented, and the end accessories are plug-and-play.

- Zero foundation, easy to get started
  - It is easy to get started and use, and the graphical programming language allows you to easily start the journey of using the robotic arm.

- Support ROS ecology
  - It is developed using the global mainstream robot communication framework ROS, and supports simulation, control and algorithm verification in a virtual environment, which reduces the requirements for the experimental environment and improves the experimental efficiency.

- Super cost-effective
  - The first robotic arm that truly realizes one machine for every hand and can be played by everyone.

### **3 Application scenarios**

#### **3.1 Intelligent palletizing**

- Simulate an industrial robotic arm, realize a variety of palletizing methods, build your own mini smart warehouse, and achieve more exciting things.

#### **3.2 Object recognition and grasping**

- Recognize colors through machine vision, and realize the sorting, sorting, and palletizing of objects by the robotic arm. The creativity of various gameplays is unlimited.

#### **3.3 Writing, drawing, touch**

- The perfect combination of robotic arm and art, creating infinite possibilities.

#### **3.4 Composite robo**

- The mobile compound robot allows the workspace to expand sufficiently to allow it to complete more tasks.
