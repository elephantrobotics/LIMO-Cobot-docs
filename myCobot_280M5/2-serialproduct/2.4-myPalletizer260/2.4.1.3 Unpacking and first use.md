### **2 Installation conditions and requirements**

​		The actual weight of the myPalletizer robot is 960g. Considering that during use, as the robot moves, its center of gravity will move, so the robot needs to be fixed on a solid base before it can be used normally. Base weight requirements: fixed base, or mobile base.

**Robot base interface size**

​		The base fixing hole is the interface between the fixed robot and other bases or planes. The specific hole size is shown in the figure below, and it is installed with LEGO components.

![2.1.1.1.2P1](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2411图片3.png)

Please make sure there are corresponding holes on the fixed base before installing.

Before the official installation, please confirm:

- The environment to be installed meets the requirements of Section 2.4.1.3.2 above.

- The installation position is not smaller than the working range of the robot, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance and repair.

- Put the stand in a suitable position.

- Installation related tools are ready.

​		After confirming the above, please move the robot to the base mounting table, adjust the robot position, and align the fixing holes of the robot base with the holes on the base mounting table. After aligning the hole, press it.

​		**Note**: When adjusting the position of the robot on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body, so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

### **3 Power on the robot**

Before operation, please confirm that you have read and ensured that you have followed the contents of Chapter 1 Safety Instructions to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter to the robotic arm, and fix the base of the robotic arm on the table. The connection method is shown in Figure 3-1.

![图](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2413图片3.png)

​																		Figure 3-1 Location of the power connector

​		myPalletizer must be powered with an external power supply to provide sufficient power:

- Rated voltage: 8-12V

- Rated current: 5A

- Plug Type: DC 5.5mm x 2.5

Note that you can't just use the TypeC plugged into the M5Stack-basic for powering. Use an official power supply to avoid damage to the robotic arm.

### **4 Driver Installation**

Users can download the corresponding CP210X or CP34X driver compressed package according to the operating system they are using, and after decompressing the compressed package, select the installation package with the corresponding operating system digits for installation.

There are currently two driver chip versions, CP210X (applicable to CP2104 version) / CP34X (applicable to CH9102 version) driver package. If you are not sure which USB chip your device is using, you can install both drivers at the same time.

### **5 Use USB to connect computer**

![2.1.1.1.QRcodepng](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2413图片4.png)

Figure 3-2 Schematic diagram of the USB interface

\1) Use the Type-C cable to connect to the computer and the corresponding USB interface of the robotic arm M5Stack-basic, and check the connection. Connection detection is a detection function for the connection status of the motors and Atoms in the robot arm. This feature makes it easy for customers to troubleshoot equipment.

\2) After passing the connection detection, if the device is not faulty, the communication forwarding detection can be performed. The timeliness of communication is very important for the microcontroller manipulator. For the microcontroller manipulator, we usually send control commands to the M5Stack-basic of the base, and forward them through communication, and the end effector will parse the commands and then execute the target action. .
