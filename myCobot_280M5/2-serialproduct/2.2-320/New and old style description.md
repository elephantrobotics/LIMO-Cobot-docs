* The two models mainly differ in appearance.
  * As the two pictures shown below, their positioning grooves are different.

When some old accessories are used on the 2022 model, the positioning grooves on the accessories must be cut off to be installed normally (currently the old accessories that need to cut the positioning grooves are only: [Module Sucking Disc](../2.7-accessories/2.7.6-320pump.md), [ electric gripper ](../2.7-accessories/2.7.8-GE.md) The rest of the accessories do not distinguish between new and old machines)
