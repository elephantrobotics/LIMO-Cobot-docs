1. Type C interface is used to connect and communicate with the PC, available for developers.
2. Screen is used to display the communication status of myCobot and calibrate the robot move to starting point with a 2-inch IPS screen.
3. Button A, Button B and Button C is used to work with the screen in a coordinated way.
4. Power switch is used to control the main power input. If it is switched off, the controller is also powered off.
5. 24V output: Internal DC24V, available for users.
6. Digital Input/Digital Output includes 6 digital input signals and 6 digital output signals. They are mainly used to interact with and constitute an important part of the automation system with other devices. It should be noted that the output signal is in the form of PNP. The following picture is a schematic diagram of the external wiring:

* The input signal is in NPN form, the following picture is the schematic diagram of external wiring:

![NPN接线图](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/NPN接线图.png)

* Power DC input interface: 

  It uses KPPX-4P R7BFDC power socket. The 24V10A DC power adapter provided by the manufacturer can also be used to power myCobot320.

* Emergency stop circuit terminal is connected to the emergency stop button box, which can be used to control the emergency stop of the robot.

>  **Notice**: The emergency stop switch must be connected when the robot is in use, and make sure that the emergency stop switch circuit is always connected.

9. IO interface. The tool I/O diagram is shown on the figure below. myCobot 320 robot has one-way input and two-way output.

​															 ![IO](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/IO.png)			

The definition of each tool I/O port is shown in the table below. Note that both the input and output of the I/O are in a form of PNP. and the wire connection method is as same as the bottom output interface.
