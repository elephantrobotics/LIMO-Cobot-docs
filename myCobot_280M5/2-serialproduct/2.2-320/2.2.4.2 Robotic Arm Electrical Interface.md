1. Type C interface is used to connect and communicate with the PC, available for developers.
2. MircoHDMI interface is an HDMI D-type interface, which is connected to the monitor. HDMI interface 1 is recommended as HDMI interface 2 is prioritized.
3. Power switch is used to control the main power input. If it is switched off, the controller is also powered off.
4. Digital Input/Digital Output includes 6 digital input signals and 6 digital output signals. They are mainly used to interact with and constitute an important part of the automation system with other devices. It should be noted that the output signal is in the form of PNP. The following picture is a schematic diagram of the external wiring:

5. 24V output: Internal DC24V, available for users.
6. Emergency stop circuit terminal is connected to the emergency stop button box, which can be used to control the emergency stop of the robot.

> **Notice**: The emergency stop switch must be connected when the robot is in use, and make sure that the emergency stop switch circuit is always connected.

7. Power DC input interface:

   It uses KPPX-4P R7BFDC power socket. The 24V10A DC power adapter provided by the manufacturer can also be used to power myCobot320.

8. USB interface is an interface for data connection with serial standards 2.0 and 3.0. Users can use the USB interface to copy program files, or use the USB interface to connect peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.

9. Network port is the port for network data connection.  Users can use the Ethernet interface for communication and interaction between the PC and the robot system, and for Ethernet communication with other devices.

10. IO interface. As shown is the tool I/O diagram, myCobot 320 has one-way input and two-way output.

![img](../../resourse/2-serialproduct/IO.png) 

The definition of each tool I/O port is shown in the table below. Note that both the input and output of the I/O are in a form of PNP. and the wire connection method is as same as the bottom output interface.
