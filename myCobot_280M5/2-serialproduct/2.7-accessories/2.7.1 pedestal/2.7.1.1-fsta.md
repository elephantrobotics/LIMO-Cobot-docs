### 使用说明：
### **Instructions for use:**

**Suitable for flat and smooth surfaces**

- Install suction cups on the four corners of the base and tighten them.

-  Connect the flat base and the bottom of the robotic arm with the included LEGO tech parts.

- Fix the four suction cups on a flat and smooth surface before starting to use.

**Tips** 

You can properly add a small amount of non-conductive liquid under the suction cup to fill the gap between the suction cup and the desktop to obtain the best adsorption effect.
