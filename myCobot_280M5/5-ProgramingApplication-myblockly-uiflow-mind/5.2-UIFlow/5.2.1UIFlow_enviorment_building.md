#### Installing the driver

> Click the link below to download the driver matching your operating system. There are two driver chip versions (CP210X/CH9102) at present. Download the driver zip file corresponding to the version you are using. After unzipping the zip file, select the installation package corresponding to the number of operating systems to be installed. If you are not sure of the USB chip used for your equipment, you can install these two drivers at the same time. During installation, an error may occur; however, the installation has been done, so the error can be ignored.) CH9102_VCP_SER_MacOS
