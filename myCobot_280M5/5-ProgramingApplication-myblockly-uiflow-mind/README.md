## What's drag-and-drop programming?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drag-and-drop" programming is a basic technology which allows programming by dragging and dropping code building blocks or using other vision clues instead of writing text-based codes manually. Therefore, it makes complex and abstract programming languages easy to understand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hadi Partovi, the founder of Code.org, once said "that drag-and-drop programming allows you to understand programming basics easily without carefully studying character arrangement. Once knowing the basic concepts to use drag and drop, you will immediately want to learn how to use them to do actual things." This completely follows the basic logic for learning programming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of programs can help you get started with drag and drop programming, which include Google Blocky, Microsoft MakeCode, MIT Scratch, etc.

## What are myBlockly and UIFlow respectively
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both **myBlockly** and **UIFlow** implement the model of drag-and-drop programming. The former is developed by the R&D team of Shenzhen Elephant Robotics Company, and the latter is a graphical programming platform developed by M5Stack.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**myBlockly** [▶](5.1-myblockly/README.md) is a piece of puzzle programming software based on python environments and pymycobot dependent libraries, which allows the user to do programming in a block building way to control mycobot. It is suitable for programming learners and can train their programming logic skills. myblockly also provides a python display interface, which can convert the myblockly program built by the user to a python language one to help the user learn python statements.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However **UIFlow** [▶](5.2-UIFlow/README.md) is a programming tool specially designed for M5 hardware system, which uses Blockly graphical programming and Python code programming. It not only provides programming learners with friendly programming experience, but also delivers more professional and crucial programming knowledge.
