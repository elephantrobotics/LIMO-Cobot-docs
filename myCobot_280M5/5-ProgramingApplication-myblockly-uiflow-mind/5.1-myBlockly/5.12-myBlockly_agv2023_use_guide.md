According to the above building blocks, the machine will do the following actions:

- Set the machine RGB light mode to flash mode and  color to Red 255.
- Wait 2 seconds.
- The machine is moving forward at a speed of 10.
- Wait 2 seconds (while the machine is moving forward).
- The machine is moving backward at a speed of 20.
- Wait 2 seconds (while the machine is moving backwards).
- The machine is spinning clockwise at the speed of 1.
- Wait 2 seconds (while the machine rotates clockwise).
- Machine stop.

   - Overall motion control block: Run this block to control the movement of the machine, the block of `Retreat (-) Front (+)` means: when the value is positive, the machine moves forward; When it is negative, the machine moves backward; When the value is zero, there is no movement. The same applies to `Right (-) Left (+)` and  `CW (-) CCW (+) ` .
   - Forward motion Block: Run this block to control the machine to move forward at a given speed.
   - Retreat Motion Block: Run this block to control the machine to move backward at a given speed.
   - Left motion Block: Run this block to control the machine to move left at a given speed.
   - Moving block to the right: Run this block to control the machine to move to the right at a given speed.
   - Counterclockwise: Run this block to control the machine to rotate counterclockwise at the given speed.
   - Clockwise: Run this block to control the machine to rotate clockwise at the given speed.
   - Stop Block: Run this block to stop the machine.
