* Motion:

  Initiating system, arms move to starting point, after 2 seconds,
  
  Joint 1 move to 50 degree at the speed of 20, after 2 seconds, 
  
  Joint 2 move to -50 degree at the speed of 20, after 2 seconds, 
  
  the above process loops again, 
  
  Joint 1, Joint 2, Joint 3 and Joint 4 move to 130 degree, 80 degree, -60 degree and 100 degree respectively.
  
  Motion stops, and then all servos release.
