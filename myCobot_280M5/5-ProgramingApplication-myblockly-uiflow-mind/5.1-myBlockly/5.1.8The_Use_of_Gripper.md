# The Use of Gripper

*Preparation*

M5Stack series: Make sure the robot is connected with PC (Go to **[5.1 myBlockly](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.1-myblockly/)** for more information).

Other series: Make sure the robot is in normal status.

This section takes myPalletizer 260 M5Stack as an example to explain the use of gripper. Go to **[2.8 Accessories](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/2-serialproduct/2.7-accessories/2.7-accessories.html)** for more information about gripper.

### Simple Demo

* Program for display

* Motion:

  Joint 2 move to 30 degree at the speed of 50,

  after 2 seconds, gripper opens at the speed of 70,

  after 2 seconds, gripper closes at the speed of 70,

  the process loops 5 times.
