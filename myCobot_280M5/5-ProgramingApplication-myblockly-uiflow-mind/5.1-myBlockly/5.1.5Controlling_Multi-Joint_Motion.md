# Controlling Multi-Joint Motion

*Preparation*

M5Stack series: Make sure robot is connected with PC (Go to **[5.1 myBlockly](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.1-myblockly/)** for more information).

Other series: Make sure the robot is in normal status.



## Purpose for this section

This section introduces instructions for controlling multi-joint motion.

### Introduction to API

* `Set Angle ()`

* Parameters:

  Joint angle: set angles within its due range according to your needs (refer to **[2 Products Profile](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/2-serialproduct/2-buy.html)**)

  Speed: set speed within its due range according to your needs (refer to **[2 Products Profile](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/2-serialproduct/2-buy.html)**)

* Function: multiple joints move to corresponding degree at the preset speed.

### Simple Demo

* Program for display:

* Motion:

  Arms move to the starting point,

  after 2 seconds, Joint 1, Joint 2, Joint 3 and Joint 4 move to 30 degree, 30 degree, -30 degree and 50 degree respectively at the speed of 50,

  after 2 seconds, arms move to the starting point at the speed of 50,

  after 2 seconds, Joint 1, Joint 2, Joint 3 and Joint 4 move to -30 degree, 0 degree, 30 degree and -50 degree respectively at the speed of 50,

  program is over in 2 seconds.
