# First-Time Use

## Preparing for the first-time use

Follow the steps below to download Python and burn firmware via MyStudio.

**Step 1** Download Python. myBlockly is used in Python environment. Make sure Python is downloaded on PC (**[Reference for information about configuration of Python environment](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/7-ApplicationBasePython/7.1_download.html)**).

**Step 2** Burning firmware. 

* Before burning firmware, download corresponding serial port driver according to the USB chip on your PC. CP210X is suitable for CP2104 version and CP34X is suitable for CH9102 version. You can install both of them if you are unable to confirm the type of USB chip. Go to the address below to download and install serial port driver.
  * serial port driver for M5Stack-basic:
    * CP210X: **[Windows 10](https://download.elephantrobotics.com/software/drivers/CP210x_VCP_Windows.zip)**, **[MacOS](https://download.elephantrobotics.com/software/drivers/CP210x_VCP_MacOS.zip)**, **[Linux](https://download.elephantrobotics.com/software/drivers/CP210x_VCP_Linux.zip)**
    * CP34X: **[Windows 10](https://download.elephantrobotics.com/software/drivers/CH9102_VCP_SER_Windows.exe)**, **[MacOS](https://download.elephantrobotics.com/software/drivers/CH9102_VCP_MacOS.zip)**
  * serial port driver for Atom:
    * **[Windows 10](https://download.elephantrobotics.com/software/drivers/CDM21228_Setup.zip)**

> **Notice:**
>
> *  An error may be reported during installation of CH9102_VCP_SER_MacOS. However, the installation already completes. Just ignore the error.
> *  Go to **[4.1.1 MyStudio Installing driver](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/4.1.1-myStudio_download_driverinstalled.html)** for specific information about serial port driver installation.
> *  Make sure that settings of the system \"Preferred settings -> Security and privacy ->General\" is correct and allow the user to get it from App Store or an approved developer.

**Step 3** M5Stack-basic burning is not required on Raspberry Pi series and JETSON NANO series, and their lasted atomMain on Atom is factory burnt.

**Step 4** For M5Stack series, miniRobot is required to be burnt on M5Stack-basic via MyStudio.  The lasted atomMain on Atom is factory burnt. Go to **[4.1 MyStudio](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/)** for its download and installation. Follow the steps below to burn miniRobot.

## Installing myBlockly

Go to the addresses below to download myBlockly.

* **[Github](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/myblockly-package/releases)**
* **[Official Web](https://www.elephantrobotics.com/download/)**

> **Notice:**
>
> Make sure to download the latest version.


## Before use

- Before start to programming, be sure to select the ** corresponding machine model **, otherwise it is easy to cause hardware damage

## myBlockly View

<img src="../../resourse/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/image/myblockly/myBlockly view1.jpg" style="zoom:33%;" />

* API blocks:

  * Display API used to generate programs
  * API used for MyCobot 320

* Other tools controlling robots:

  * Click on the pink icon in the top right corner to select the corresponding robot type, serial port and baud rate.
  * Tap `Joints Control`  or `Coordination Control` for joints' real-time angles and coords.
  * Tap `+` or `-` to control robot movements.

* Generated program:

  * Make sure to select the correct robot type, serial port and baud rate before utilization. Otherwise the program may report an error. Check the version of myBlockly if serial port and baud rate do not change correspondingly.
  * Programs are created by dragging API blocks from the left side.

**Notice:**

1. Baud rate for M5Stack series and Raspberry Pi series is 115200 and 1000000 respectively.


  | Robot | Port | Baudrate |
  |:---------:| :--------:|:--------:|
  |260 M5| Win: COM*; Linux: /dev/ttyUSB*;|115200|
  |270 M5| Win: COM*; Linux: /dev/ttyUSB*;|115200|
  |280 M5| Win: COM*; Linux: /dev/ttyUSB*;|115200|
  |320 M5| Win: COM*; Linux: /dev/ttyUSB*;|115200|
  |260 PI|  /dev/ttyAMA0|1000000|
