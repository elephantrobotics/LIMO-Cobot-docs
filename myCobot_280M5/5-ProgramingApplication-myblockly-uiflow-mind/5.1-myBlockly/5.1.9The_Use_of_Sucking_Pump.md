# The Use of Sucking Pump

*Preparation*

M5Stack series: Make sure robot is connected with PC (Go to **[5.1 myBlockly](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.1-myblockly/)** for more information).

Other series: Make sure the robot is in normal status.

This section takes myPalletizer 260 M5Stack as an example to explain the use of suction pump. Go to **[2.8 Accessories](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/2-serialproduct/2.7-accessories/2.7-accessories.html)** for more information about sucking pump.



## Purpose for this section

This section introduces instructions for using sucking pump.

### Introduction to API

> **Notice:** M5Stack version is unable to use the blocks belonging to Raspberry Pi version. Otherwise, the system may report an error.

* `Set Basic pin () output ()` (for M5Stack version)

  <img src="../../resourse/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/image/myblockly/set basic pin output.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Applicable to myCobot 280 series,  mechArm 270 series, and myPalletizer 260 series

* Parameter:
  * `pin ()` :  the numerical part of the numbers marked at the bottom of the equipment
  * `output ()`: `0` means setting to the running state, and `1` means setting to the stop state

* Function: set the working state of the preset bottom pin



* `get_basic_input(pin_no)` (for M5Stack version)

* Applicable to myCobot 280 series,  mechArm 270 series, and myPalletizer 260 series
* Parameter:
  * `pin()`: the numerical part of the numbers marked at the bottom of the equipment
* Function: get the working state of the bottom pin number



* `set mode ()` (for Raspberry Pi version )

<img src="../../resourse/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/image/myblockly/set mode.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Applicable to myCobot 280 series,  mechArm 270 series, and myPalletizer 260 series
* Parameter:
  * `mode()` : "BCM" or "BOARD" 
* Function: set Raspberry Pi GPIO Pin Mode



* `set pin() mode()` (for Raspberry Pi version )

<img src="../../resourse/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/image/myblockly/set pin mode.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Applicable to myCobot 280 series,  mechArm 270 series, and myPalletizer 260 series
* Parameter:
  * `pin ()` :  the numerical part of the numbers marked at the bottom of the equipment
  * `mode ()`: `in` means signal import, and `OUT`means signal output
* Function: set signal of the preset bottom pin



* `set pin() output()` (for Raspberry Pi version )

<img src="../../resourse/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/image/myblockly/set pin output.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Applicable to myCobot 280 series,  mechArm 270 series, and myPalletizer 260 series
* Parameter:
  * `pin()` : the numerical part of the numbers marked at the bottom of the equipment
  * `output()`ï¼š`HIGH`  means high level of sucking pump working state, and  `LOW` means low level of sucking pump working state
* Function: set the working state of bottom pin to high level or low level

### Simple Demo

* Program for display:

  <img src="../../resourse/5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/image/myblockly/sucking pump demo.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />



* Motion:

  Sucking pump vibrates and work to suck objects,

  after 2 seconds, sucking pump put objects down,

  after 2 seconds, it vibrates again. The whole process loops 5 times.
