## 1 Product background：

* myCobot artificial intelligence kit is an entry-level artificial intelligence suit integrating vision, positioning and grabbing, and automatic sorting modules. Based on the Linux system, build a 1:1 simulation model in ROS, which can realize the control of the robotic arm through the development of software. It is simple and easy to learn. It can quickly learn the basics of artificial intelligence, inspire innovative thinking, and comprehend the open-source creative culture.
* The suit has good scalability and high openness and can be used for multiple purposes. It is easy to use the training platform of colleges and universities, the construction of robotics disciplines, the robotics laboratory or personal learning and use.



## 2 Product performance
