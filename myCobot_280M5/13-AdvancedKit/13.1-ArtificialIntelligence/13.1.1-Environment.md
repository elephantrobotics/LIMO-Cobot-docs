## Construction of working environment


First of all, it should be clear that all case experiments are based on *Python + opencv + pymycobot*. Therefore, when using M5 manipulator, *myStudio* needs to burn atom firmware and transport firmware at the head and bottom of the manipulator respectively. 

Since it is troublesome to install *opencv version 4.5.3* in *Linux* system, and in order to reduce the difficulty of environment construction, we will provide *Linux* system image, *virtual box* installation package and its expansion package. Next, we will teach you how to install *virtual box* and import *Linux* system image.(The default password is **123**)

**1 Virtual Box install**

Click the link to download the installation package:

* [Ubuntu 16.04](https://download-elephantrobotics.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Product_software/iMage-ISO/AI_Kit/AI_myCobot_280_M5_ubuntu16.04_V20221208.zip)

Double click *virtualbox-6.1.24-145767-win.exe* to install as follows.

**Step 2: Install the suction pump**
**1** Female cable--The power cable end is connected to the port on the left side of the suction pump, the other end is connected to the outlet end of one input and two outlets, the other end is connected to the power port of the robot arm, and the inlet end is connected to the power adapter.

**2** The pin end of the DuPont wire is connected to the interface for controlling the motor and solenoid valve as noted in the wiring diagram, and the other end is connected to pins 20 and 21 of the robotic arm.
