# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as part of a web page, and it allows client-side scripts to interact with the user and generate dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented functions.<br>

JavaScript is a very well-known programming language, and it was originally used twenty years ago with the purpose of vivifying web pages.
 It is also an important part of the skill set for web developers. The JavaScript scripting language is not dependent on an operating system, and it only requires the support of a browser. Therefore, a JavaScript script can be taken to any machine after it has been written, provided that the browser on the machine supports the JavaScript scripting language. JavaScript is already supported by most browsers.

JavaScript is easy to learn but difficult to master, and it is used for a variety of purposes, from simply enhancing the functions of a website to running cool games and web-based software.
