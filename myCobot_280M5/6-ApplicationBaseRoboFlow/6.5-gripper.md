## 1 The equipment that the adaptive gripper 
supports: myCobot280, myCobot320 and myPalletizer 260.<br>
Function description: <br>
- Run RoboFlow, enter the program editing interface, and select M5Stack-basic – Gripper (For the way to enter the program editing interface, see 6.2 Simple use of RoboFlow); <br>

- IO mode (I/O is selected by the Tool, and the overall steps are shown in the figure)

- click Define New Gripper, fill in Gripper Name as " CAG-1 ” (must be this name), and then click Save; <br>

- select open or close for Saved status. The overall steps are shown in the following figure: <br>
  
   (Note: Before using the transparent transmission mode, you need to set the gripper to the transparent transmission mode, that is, set_cag_gripper_mode (0), please refer to [Socket API](http://localhost:4000/2-serialproduct/2.3-myCobot_Pro_600/2.3.5%20socket%20API%20interface%20description.html)) for detailed interface use.)
