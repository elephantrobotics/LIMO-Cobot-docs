## Jetson nano version robot instructions

### 1 Getting Started with Robots

### 1.1 Robot Equipment Description

- **Supported Device Models**
  
   - myCobot280 Jetson nano
  
  
- **Brief Description of Jetson Nano Model Device Features**
  
   - The Jetson nano version machine is the official joint product of Elephant Robot and **Invidia**, and the robotic arm uses [**Jetson nano**](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-nano-2gb-devkit-user-guide#id-.JetsonNano2GBDeveloperKitUserGuidevbatuu_v1.0-Introduction) The core processor is designed to meet the needs of customers **Linux** system applications and the needs of integrated robot development and convenient equipment. The product retains Jetson nano's native hardware interface, and the device has a built-in **Ubuntu 20.04** operating system, **python ROS myBlockly** and other development environments,
  
   - Jetson nano version machine is embedded with Jetson nano, 1.43GHz 4-core microprocessor, runs Debian/Ubuntu platform, supports 3-way USB, 1-way HDMI, standardized GPIO interface, TF card can be plugged and unplugged
  

- **Jetson nano model robot is the host computer**

   - The essence of the Jetson nano version machine is a development board with an independent system, which can be regarded as a miniature computer host, and the communication between the host and the host cannot be simply formed through a wire. It can only be connected to an independent monitor, and with a power supply, mouse, and keyboard, it can be developed and operated after entering the built-in system of the development board

  

### 1.2 Start using your device

- **Connect external devices**
  
   - The Jetson nano version machine does not need to be equipped with PCs, notebooks and other equipment, and can be connected to the monitor for application development (**Reminder⚠: Please use the included HDMI cable to connect the monitor and use the built-in system for development**)
  
   - First plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI interface of the monitor

### 2.3 Connect Network

The Jetson nano version of the robotic arm only supports wired network connections. The following describes the connection method for PCs to share the network through network cables:
   - 1. You need to prepare a network cable and a USB docking station with a network port
     <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_7.jpg" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   - 2. Connect one end of the network cable to the network port of the robot arm, and the other end to the network card of the expansion dock, and connect the USB interface of the expansion dock to the PC.
     - The first connection to the PC will appear in the form of a driver, and a new driver needs to be installed to recognize the Ethernet of the robotic arm. The following prompt will appear in the lower right corner of the desktop:
         <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_8.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
         Clicking the prompt will open the following interface, click Run:
         <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_9.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
         After the operation is completed, the PC can recognize the Ethernet of the robotic arm.

   - 3. PC search `control panel` through the search bar, open the control panel <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_1.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80 %;" />Select `View network status and tasks`<img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_2.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />Click `Change Adapter Settings`<img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_3.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />Select PC Connected network, right click and click `Properties`<img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_4.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" /> and then Select `Sharing`, check `Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection`, and select the `Ethernet` of the robotic arm (some computers do not have this option, just leave it unchecked), click `OK` to exit .
   <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_5.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_6.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   - 3. After completing the above steps, the robotic arm system, through the shortcut keys `ctrl`+`alt`+`t`, open the terminal, enter `ifconfig` and press Enter, and `eth0` appears, indicating that the networking is successful:
    <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_11.png" align = "center"  style="zoom:80%;" />

### 2.4 VNC

***The premise of using VNC is that the robot arm has been connected to the network, and [VNC viewer](https://vnc-viewer.en.softonic.com/) software needs to be installed on the PC side***

- **VNC function introduction**
  
   - It is a remote control software, generally used to remotely solve computer failures or software debugging
  
  
- **VNC port description**
  
   - The robot arm and the PC are connected under the same WiFi or share the network to the robot arm through a network cable, and the IP address of the robot arm is the port
  
  
- **Connect to VNC**
   - After connecting to the network through a network cable, use the shortcut keys `ctrl`+`alt`+`t` to open the terminal, enter `ifconfig` and press Enter, you can get the network IP address of the robotic arm:
     <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_11.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   - Open the VNC viewer software on the PC, enter the IP address of the robotic arm, and press Back

    <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/vnc_connect.png" align = "center"  style="zoom:80%;" />
  - 
  
  
  
### 2.5 SSH

- **SSH function introduction**
  
   - Simply put, SSH is a network protocol for encrypted logins between computers. If a user logs in to another remote computer using the SSH protocol from a local computer, we can assume that this login is safe, even if it is intercepted midway, the password will not be revealed.
  
  
- **SSH port description**
  
   - default port 22, no need to change
  
  
- **SSH First Connection**
    
   - Press `win + R` on the personal computer to open the running interface, and enter `cmd` in the input box
     <img src="../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.1-280/Pi/2.1.5.4/ssh-1.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   - After inputting, click OK to open the shell interface
     <img src="../../resourse/2-serialproduct/2.1-280/Pi/2.1.5.4/ssh-2.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   - Type `ssh er@er.local` and press Enter.
   - The following prompt appears, enter `yes` and press Enter
     <img src="../../resourse/3-RobotKnowledge/JN/JN_internet_10.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
   - Then enter the password `Elephant`, the entered password will not be displayed, just enter it normally.
As shown in the figure above, the remote ssh connection has been successful

### 2.6 Language Configuration
