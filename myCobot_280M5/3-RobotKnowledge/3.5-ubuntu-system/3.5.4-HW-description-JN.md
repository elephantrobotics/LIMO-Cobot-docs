### 1.1 40PIN GPIO

- **Introduction**

   - GPIO full name: General-purpose input/output port (General-purpose input/output)
  
   - At present, all Jetson nano GPIOs of our company are basically the same as those on the Raspberry Pi motherboard, and they all have a 40-pin GPIO header

> Note: The following are GPIOs in BCM mode
  
  
- **Voltage Description**

   - There are two 5V pins and two 3.3V pins on the board, as well as multiple ground pins (0V), which are not configurable. The rest of the pins are all general purpose 3.3V pins, meaning the output is set to 3.3V and the input is 3.3V allowed
  
  
- **IO output**
  
   - GPIO pins designated as output pins can be set high (3.3V) or low (0V)
  
  
- **IO input**
  
   - GPIO pins designated as input pins can be read as high (3.3V) or low (0V). It is easier to use internal pull-up or pull-down resistors. Pins GPIO2 and GPIO3 have fixed pull-up resistors, but for other pins this is configurable in software
  
  
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**
  
   - All pins can be PWM controlled using software
  
   - GPIO12, GPIO13 can use hardware to control PWM
  
- **SPI**
  
   - SPI is called Serial Peripheral Interface (Serial Peripheral Interface), which is a high-speed, full-duplex, synchronous communication bus
  
   - SPI0: MOSI (GPIO10); MISO (GPIO9); SCLK (GPIO11); CS0 (GPIO8), CS1 (GPIO7)
  
   - SPI1: MOSI (GPIO26); MISO (GPIO25); SCLK (GPIO27); CS0 (GPIO24); CS1 (GPIO23);
  
  
- **IIC**
  
   - I2C, the full name of the Chinese integrated circuit bus, is a serial communication bus, using a multi-master-slave architecture
  
   - Data (GPI02), Clock (GPI03)
  
   - EEPROM data: (GPIO0), EEPROM clock (GPI01)
  
  
- **Serial**
  
   - Serial port is the abbreviation of serial interface (serial port), also known as serial communication interface or COM interface
  
   - TX (GPIO14), RX (GPIO15)
  
  
- **python control pin output**
  
     ```python
       import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
       import time
            
       # initialization
       GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
       GPIO.setup(20, GPIO.OUT)
       GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)
       # high level
       GPIO. output(20, 0)
       GPIO. output(21, 0)
       # wait 2 seconds
       time. sleep(2)
       # low level
       GPIO. output(20, 1)
       GPIO. output(21, 1)
     ```
    
    
- The definition of each interface of **GPIO is shown in the table below:

### 1.2 Base interface description

* A. Power supply DC interface: Use a DC power socket with an outer diameter of 6.5mm and an inner diameter of 2.0mm; the 12V 5A DC power adapter provided by the manufacturer can be used to power myCobot 280.

* B. Key switch: After pressing it, the internal power is on, and the white light of the key is on; press it again, the white light is off, and the internal power is cut off.
  
* C. Type-C: Jetson nano has its own power supply port, which only supplies power to Jetson nano itself and cannot supply power to the entire machine. Therefore, it is not necessary to connect this port when the DC port of the power supply can be used normally.
 
* D. HDMI: This interface is an HDMI A-type interface. If the robot operation interface needs to be displayed, the user can display the operation page to other device terminals by connecting the HDMI display interface.

* E. USB2.0: The interface for data connection with serial bus standard 2.0; users can use the USB interface to copy program files, or use the USB interface to connect peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.


* F. USB3.0: The interface for data connection with serial bus standard 3.0; users can use the USB interface to copy program files, or use the USB interface to connect peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.

* G. Network port: the port for network data connection. The user can use the Ethernet interface for communication between the PC and the robot system, and also for Ethernet communication with other devices. **Since Jetson nano itself does not have a network card , so Jetson nano can only connect to this network port through a network cable to access the Internet**.
