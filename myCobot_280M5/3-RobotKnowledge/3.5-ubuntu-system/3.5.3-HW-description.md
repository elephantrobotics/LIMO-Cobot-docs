### Hardware interface usage

### 3.1 40PIN GPIO

- **Introduction**
  
  - GPIO：General-purpose input/output
  - At present, all our Raspberry PI motherboards have a 40-pin GPIO head
  
- **Voltages**
  
  - Two 5V pins and two 3.3V pins are present on the board, as well as a number of ground pins (0V), which are unconfigurable. The remaining pins are all general purpose 3.3V pins, meaning outputs are set to 3.3V and inputs are 3.3V-tolerant.
  
- **Outputs**
  
  - A GPIO pin designated as an output pin can be set to high (3.3V) or low (0V).
  
- **Inputs**
  
  - A GPIO pin designated as an input pin can be read as high (3.3V) or low (0V). This is made easier with the use of internal pull-up or pull-down resistors. Pins GPIO2 and GPIO3 have fixed pull-up resistors, but for other pins this can be configured in software.
  
- **PWM (pulse-width modulation)**
  
  - Software PWM available on all pins
  - Hardware PWM available on GPIO12, GPIO13, GPIO18, GPIO19
  
- **SPI**
  
  - SPI0: MOSI (GPIO10); MISO (GPIO9); SCLK (GPIO11); CE0 (GPIO8), CE1 (GPIO7)
  - SPI1: MOSI (GPIO20); MISO (GPIO19); SCLK (GPIO21); CE0 (GPIO18); CE1 (GPIO17); CE2 (GPIO16)
  
- **IIC**
  
  - Data: (GPIO2); Clock (GPIO3)
  - EEPROM Data: (GPIO0); EEPROM Clock (GPIO1)
  
- **Serial**
  
  - TX (GPIO14);RX (GPIO15)
  
- **Use python to control IO**
  
    ```python      
      from pymycobot.mycobot import MyCobot
      from pymycobot import PI_PORT, PI_BAUD
      import time
      
      mc = MyCobot(PI_PORT, PI_BAUD)
      
      # Init
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      GPIO.setup(20, GPIO.OUT)
      GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)
      # HIGH
      GPIO.output(20, 0)
      GPIO.output(21, 0)
      # WAIT
      time.sleep(2)
      # LOW
      GPIO.output(20, 1)
      GPIO.output(21, 1)      
    ```
