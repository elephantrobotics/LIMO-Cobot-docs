- **PI device function description**

  - PI version robots is a joint product developed by Elephant Robotics and **Raspberry Pi**. Adopting the **Raspberry PI 4B** as its core processor, and reserving the origin hardware interface of RaspBerry PI 4B, the robotic arm meets the application needs of **Linux system** with one-in-all structure for portable robot development. Featuring built-in **Ubuntu 18.04. system** as well as  development environments like **Python**, **ROS** and **myBlockly**, it can be developed after connecting with displayer without matching with PC.  

  - PI version robotic arms is embedded with Raspberry PI 4B, 1.5GHz 4-core microprocessor, runs Debian/Ubuntu platform, supports 4 USB channels, 2 HDMI channels, standardized GPIO interface, TF card is removable
    

- **PI robots are computer hosts**

  - The essence of the PI version robotic arms is a development board with an independent system, which can be seen as a miniature computer host. The communication between the host and the host cannot be simply constituted by a wire. It can only be connected to an independent monitor, and equipped with power supply, mouse and keyboard, and can be developed and operated after entering the built-in system of the development board
