# Joint Control

For a serial multi-joint robot, the control of the joint space is to control the variables of each joint so as to make each joint reaches a target position at a certain speed.

> **Notice:** When setting the angle, the values corresponding to different manipulators are different. Refer to the parameter introduction section for more information.
