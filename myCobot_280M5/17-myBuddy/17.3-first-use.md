## 2 Installation Requirements

myBuddy weights 2.75kg. Given that the center of gravity changes along with the movement of the robot , it is required that the robot be fixed on a solid ground during utilization. (A fixed pedestal or mobile pedestal are both acceptable.)

### Size of Interface

The fixing holes on the pedestal serve to fix robot and connect with other pedestals.

![Base](../resourse/17-myBuddy/17.2.1-ps/mybuddy-base.png)

Please make sure that there are corresponding threaded holes on the pedestal.

*Before the official installation, please confirm:*

- The working environment meets the requirements listed in Section **15.3.1**.
- The installation position is no smaller than the working space of the robot, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance and repair.
- Put the robot in a suitable position.
- Installation related tools are ready, such as screws, wrenches, etc.

After confirming the above requeirements, please move the robot to the mounting table, adjust the robot position, and align the fixing holes with the holes on the base mounting table. And then twist the screws tightly.

**Notice:** When adjusting the position of the robot on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body, so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

## 3 Power on the Robot

Before operation, please make sure that you have read **Chapter 1 Safety Instructions**. At the same time, connect the power adapter to the robot, and fix  on the table. Refer to Figure 3-1 for connection.
